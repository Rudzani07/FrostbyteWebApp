### FRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM 

##### A beverage manufacturer provides fridges to its customers to ensure the proper refrigeraƟon of their beverages. And the exciting news? We would like you to join the cool crew creating the Fridge Management System for our beverage buddies. The comprehensive capabilities of the envisioned fridge management system are designed to address key aspects of operaƟonal efficiency and customer service. The primaryfuncƟonaliƟes of the proposed fridge management system encompass customer management, inventory control, fault reporƟng, servicing of fridges, and the oversight of fridge acquisiƟons from various suppliers.

### Background InformaƟon:

##### Presently, our beverage manufacturing company operates on a system that involves manual handling and documentation for various aspects related to providing fridges to customers. The enƟre process, from customer management to fridge acquisiƟons, relies heavily on traditional paper-based methods. Customer interactions and fridge service histories are manually recorded, posing challenges in 
providing a personalized and efficient experience. Although Excel is used to keep track of our fridges, inventory control is managed through manual tracking, making it challenging to ensure real-time insights into stock levels. Fault reporƟng involves phone calls and emails, which is rather tedious. The purchase of new fridges from different suppliers is also managed through convenƟonal methods. Considering the current operaƟonal setup, there's a pressing need for a more streamlined and technologically advanced solution. TransiƟoning to a web-based Fridge Management System would enhance the efficiency of day-to-day acƟviƟes. Customers of this beverage manufacturing company could be spaza shops or shebeens.

### SUBSYSTEMS WITH BRIEF OVERVIEWS 
##### The FRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM consists of several subsystems, with each subsystem being assigned to an individual team MEMBER. However, it is important that the TEAM collaboraƟvely oversees the integraƟon of these subsystems to ensure a cohesive and fully operaƟonal system.Please take note, that the ADMINISTRATION Subsystem is mandatory, and must be included in the FRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. This subsystem should be worked on by all TEAM members (nonnegoƟable).ALLOCATION OF SUBSYSTEMS TO TEAM MEMBERS: If your TEAM consists of only 3 MEMBERS, subsystems A to C must be included in your FRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. The allocaƟon of a subsystem to a team member must be handled within your team. Only if you have a 4th team member, will you need to include subsystem D. 


# ADMINISTRATION Subsystem
# The AdministraƟon Subsystem stands at the core of the FRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM and oversees 
# all crucial operaƟonal aspects. The subsystem also manages physical locations, customers, fridges, 
# suppliers and efficiently manages various employees, including Customer Liaison, Inventory Liaison, 
# Service Technicians, Purchasing Managers, etc. It is necessary to ensure that provision is made for the 
# types of checks that should be carried out when servicing a fridge. 

# Subsystem A: CUSTOMER MANAGEMENT Subsystem 
# A Customer Liaison should be able to manage customer data, as well as create and manage allocaƟons 
# of fridges to customers. This should facilitate seamless distribuƟon and monitoring (tracking) of 
# fridges. An Inventory Liaison must be able to manage fridge inventory, and when new fridges are 
# delivered (by Suppliers) or old/broken fridges need to be “scrapped”, stock levels should be adjusted. 
# Furthermore, the allocaƟon of fridges to customers must be catered for. When fridge inventory levels 
# are low, an internal purchase request by the Inventory Liaison should be created for the aƩenƟon of 
# the purchasing manager. Overall, the Customer and Management Subsystems play a crucial role in 
# opƟmizing customer saƟsfacƟon and operaƟonal efficiency within our fridge management system.

# Subsystem B: FRIDGE FAULT Subsystem 
The Fridge Fault Subsystem streamlines communication between customers and Fault Technicians for efficient fault resoluƟon and fridge repairs. Customers can report faults and track their fault status, as well as request new fridges. Fault Technicians should be able to view a comprehensive list of all reported faults, enabling efficient prioriƟzaƟon. Fault Technicians can process fault reports and  diagnose issues. The Fault Technicians would need to schedule and noƟfy the customer when they could perform the necessary repairs to restore funcƟonality to the affected fridges.


### Subsystem C: FRIDGE MAINTENANCE Subsystem 
##### The Fridge Maintenance Subsystem streamlines fridge maintenance operations and enhances customer visibility into maintenance acƟviƟes. Maintenance Technicians can efficiently view customer fridges, along with their maintenance and service history. They can schedule and manage maintenance visits, service fridges and create fault reports as needed. Customers should be able to view upcoming maintenance visits and access detailed fridge history, including maintenance and service records. This ensures transparent communication and efficient maintenance scheduling for opƟmal fridge performance.


### Subsystem D: 

###PURCHASING Subsystem  The Purchasing Subsystem streamlines procurement operations and fosters effective communication 
between the purchasing manager and suppliers. The Purchasing Manager can efficiently manage 
suppliers, and view & process purchase requests from the Inventory Liaison. When necessary, the Purchasing Manager creates requests for quotaƟons (RFQs), they should be automaƟcally sent to a Supplier. The Purchasing Manager should also be able to view and process quotaƟons received from 
suppliers and create purchase orders accordingly. On the supplier side, when the order has been 
processed and the fridges are ready to be delivered, a delivery note will be created. This subsystem ensures efficient procurement processes and transparent communication between purchasing  managers and suppliers for Ɵmely and accurate order fulfillment.
